    <h1>Happy 19th Boo ðŸ’œ</h1>
    <p>I know I was supposed to get you a gift but what's the point if you're not gonna get it when you're 19?</p>
   
    <p>If you were to ask me about my hb, I'd say he is cool and calm, but if you asked me on a deeper level... I'd say, people like him are one in a million and I definitely hit the jackpot cause I get to have him as my best friend. Kelvin is a rare one, he loves too deeply and isn't afraid to express it and I admire that about him. He is so supportive and protective. Everyone deserves someone like him cause he definitely makes my world so much better. âˆž</p>
     <p>Update...I wrote this before we decided to cross the border... but it still holds truth. This is how I felt then, and it's how I feel now, only deeper.....</p>
