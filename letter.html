  <h1>Not me crying while writing this....</h1>
  <p>This song really reminds me of you every time I listen to it and no, it is not only because you introduced me to it (thank you for that though cause I absolutely love love this songðŸ˜­) but because you are the Neverland to most of us, you are home to most of your friends, the kind of character that gives no room for loneliness and I love that about you. I love the fact that I at times find peace and comfort in you.</p>
  <p>Kelvin, I know this world hasn't really been the best but you have made it this far....you are literally an unc jeezðŸ˜­ YOU ARE 19!!!! I could go on and on but I don't want it to be a sad letter. Just know I appreciate you so much. Thank you for tolerating me and forcing me to be your friend cause rn I can't imagine a world in which you are not the Patrick to my SpongeBob. (Iâ€™m SpongeBob cause Patrick is dense in the head ðŸ˜…). YOU ARE LOVED, CARED FOR AND APPRECIATED BY SO MANY PEOPLE BUT MOSTLY BY ME!! I love love love you mwaaahðŸ’š.</p>
